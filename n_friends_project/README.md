# Problem: n friends
### Problem Description
N students (half from computer engineering, half from data science) are in a pizzeria for a party, after the meal they decided to go to an Irish pub with a bike. Unfortunately, the bike can take only two people for time. We want to find the fastest way to move all the N students from the pizzeria to the pub  given that:

- the bike can transport at most 2 students;

- in any moment the data scientists must be more or equal than the computer engineers.

### Development
I based my work on the code written by the professor and I extended it. My development includes giving the user the ability to choose the number of seats of the bike (minimum one) and to choose the number of data scientists and computer engineers separatly, so they can be different.
